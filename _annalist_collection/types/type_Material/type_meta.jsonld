  "rdfs:comment": "Materials appear to be fundamental to chemistry and similar scientific experiments (such as biology, environmental archaeology, and life sciences). The exact terminology used to describe materials differs depending depending on discipline, for example: \u201cInputs\u201d, \u201cReagents\u201d, \u201cStrain\u201d, \u201cProducts\u201d, \u201cSubstance\u201d, \u201cCompound\u201d, \u201cChemical\u201d, \u201cMolecule type\u201d, \u201cBatch\u201d, and \u201cSample\u201d. Materials have many properties that can change, for example the quantity, the form, the batch identifier, the manufacturer, the storage location, expiry date, and so on. Materials themselves transform during processes and may no longer be the same material - they may be combined to produce a new material or they may be split to produce different materials. Understanding the relationship between different materials and how they are changed by the process is very important. Different processes will cause different changes, and external elements can also influence whether the same process generates different changes to materials (for example humidity, temperature, contamination, time of day). A material generated by one process may be used in a new process. A material can be part of an experiment, an analysis, or can be derived from external sources such as description in literature or a materials database. ",

  "rdfs:comment": "COLLECTING A POWDER PATTERN\r\nTo run a sample:\r\nTurn the diffractometer on (if not already) using the green button and the chiller (below) using the black switch.   The \u2018operate\u2019 light should light up and the orange light up on top of the diffractometer will be lit\r\nLock the door (to stop the beeping) once the sample is in place\r\nOn the computer open up MiniFlex Guidance (shortcut on the desktop), ensuring the diffractometer is on (so that the two can connect)\r\nLogin with name \u2018MiniFlex\u2019, no password\r\nTo collect a pattern click the yellow \u2018General Measurement\u2019 button at the bottom of the left hand menu\r\n\r\n\r\nMiniFlex Guidance homescreen.PNG\r\n\r\nThis will bring up a new window\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Measurement.PNG\r\n\r\nUse the ... button next to file name to browse the folder and set the file name.  Save files in the Crystallography Advanced Practical folder (C:/X Ray Data/Crystallography Advanced Practical\u00ad), file name following the structure:\r\nINITIALS_SAMPLENAME_DATE_EXP\r\neg LM_yGlycine_1Oct13_2-50.  You will also need to enter the sample name (same as file name).\r\nSelect No1 Under condition and then use \u2018Set Meas. Conditions\u2019 to check the profile of the data collection.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeasurement conditions.PNG\r\n\r\nEnsure the profile in row 1 is as follows and the Exec box is checked for row 1:\u2028Start (deg):  3.0000\r\nStop (deg): 50.0000\r\nStep (deg): 0.020\r\nSpeed (deg/min): 10.0000\r\nVoltage (kV): 40\r\nCurrent (mA): 15\r\nThen click OK.\r\n \r\nWhen set up click \u2018Run\u2019 to start the data collection experiment. \r\nIf a message box appears saying\r\n\u2018Install optical devices as follows: Soller(inc): 2.5deg |HS:10.0mm  DS: 1.25deg\r\nSS: 1.25deg  Soller(rec): 2.5deg  RS: 0.3mm\r\nFilter: none\r\nMonochromator: none\u2019\r\nSelect OK and the experiment will start.\r\nIf error messages appear there could be a number of causes \u2013 most likely is the chiller is not on (flicking the on/off switch on the box will resolve this). \r\nWhen the experiment starts a dialog box saying \u2018executing general measurement\u2019 will appear, the pattern will start to be generated and will be visible behind the dialog boxes in real time as it is collected.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeasurement running.PNG\r\n\r\nWhen the data collection is finished the General Measurement window will no longer be greyed out and it will be possible to run another sample.   The MiniFlex generates three files (.asc, .ras and .raw) however it is also possible to export the pattern to alternative formats when still displayed on the screen.  To do this click File --> Export and this will give a section of possible formats.  X-Y (.txt) format will enable you to open the file in excel.\r\nIf you wish to run a second sample, before doing so fill in/change the details in the General Measurement window as appropriate (changing the file and sample names).  Unlock the door and replace the sample.\r\nThe Profile window displaying the pattern can be closed after the measurement is complete, or alternatively it can be left open.  In the latter case, the next pattern collected will be displayed along with the original giving an overlay of the two (which can be good for sample comparison if required).\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond pattern.PNG\r\n\r\nWhen you have finished, ensure the sample holder(s) are fully cleaned, removing all traces of your sample from the holder and area surrounding the MiniFlex600.  Please leave the area and equipment as you found them, ready for the next person/group to use.  If no-one else is waiting to use, turn off the diffractometer (white button) and the chiller unit.  \r\n",

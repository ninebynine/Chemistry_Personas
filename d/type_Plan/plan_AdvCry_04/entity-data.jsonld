You should look at each pattern separately and also overlay appropriate patterns to allow comparisons and differences to be noted.  \u2028Your observations as you are viewing and analysing the patterns should be noted, detailing the pattern you are looking at and whether you are looking at more than one or making comparisons to another.  Include an overall summary of the powder patterns and what they tell you about the individual polymorphs and starting material.  \r\n",

Please take note of and read the local safety rules displayed and ensure you are supervised when using the equipment.\r\n\r\nYou should use the microscope to inspect your crystal samples and select an appropriate crystal to run (see choosing a crystal) and ensure you do this before grinding up your sample for XRPD.\r\nThe XtaLAB mini controls (similar to MiniFlex controls)\r\n\r\nXtaLAB mini controls.PNG\r\n\r\nInside the cabinet \r\n\r\nInside XtaLAB mini.PNG\r\n\r\nAxes of rotation \r\n\r\naxes of rotation.png\r\n\r\n \r\nRUNNING A SAMPLE\r\nEnsure the all peripheral equipment is turned on \r\n\r\nPeripheral equipment.PNG\r\n\r\nThe cooling water also needs to be turned on (button on front).  \r\n\r\ncooling water power.PNG\r\n\r\nAll of these should be on before the XtaLAB mini is turned on (green button on front).  This will cause the door lock button to flash and intermittent beeping to be heard.  Press the door lock button to stop this.\r\n\r\nOpen Crystal Clear Auto 2.0 software from the desktop and login\r\nUsername: student, no password.\r\nYou may need to open a new sample or project (new sample if you already have a project, ie this is not the first crystal you have run, or a new project if you have never run a crystal on this machine before).\r\nFile --> New Project or New Sample\r\n\r\n\r\nOpen screen crystalclear.PNG\r\n\r\nThe open dialog box (Open Sample) will require you to choose your project and sample name. Tick the \u2018new project\u2019 box) and type the project name, then do the same for the sample.  Note samples (eg crystals) must have different names but there can be multiple samples in one project. \r\nProject name: AdvPrac_INITIALS eg AdvPrac_SCLM\r\nSample names (must be unique): YEAR_INITIALS_SAMPLE,   eg 2013_SCLM_001\r\nThen click OK and the instrument will initialise and you will see the Goniometer values changing.  When fully initialised, the values should read \u03c9 -70.0, \u03c7 54.0 and \u00cf\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 0.0 and the flow bar on the left hand side will progress to mount crystal, with several dialog boxes opening (second screen shot)\r\nNOTE, for all dialog boxes which open during the following process, NEVER press save.  Always \u2018run\u2019 or \u2018close\u2019 each window.\r\n\r\n\r\nInitializing values.PNG \r\n\r\nMount crystal windows.PNG\r\n\r\nYou will need to mount the crystal onto the goniometer at this point.  Press the unlock door button, and wait for a pop up to appear on the computer screen (this will only appear if the software is open, if it is not the door will unlock at this point).  Press ok when ready to open the door and the beeping will change from continuous to intermittent and you will hear the door unlock.  The door can now be opened. \r\nThe inside of the diffractometer cabinet is shown earlier detailing the different components.  Be careful not to accidentally move any components from their set positions when working.  The goniometer will be in the mount position as shown below, enabling access to it.  If you already have your crystal mounted on a goniometer head, place this onto the mount and tighten the screw (removing the head if the previous one is still in place).  Alternatively you will need to remove the head, mount your crystal on this and replace the head with the crystal on. \r\n\r\n\r\nMounting crystal.PNG\r\n\r\nOnce the crystal is affixed it will need to be centred to ensure that in any position (change of angle) the centre of the crystal remains in the same place.  To do this, look at the video image feeding to the computer.  You will see cross hairs (axes) on the display and an image of the crystal.  You need to move the crystal so that it is placed in the centre of the cross hairs when rotated on its axes (red cross below).\r\n\r\n\r\nCentring 1.PNG\r\n\r\nTo adjust the position of the crystal, you will first need to unlock the phi axis.  Use the tool to unlock as shown below (one small turn is sufficient).\r\n\r\nAdjusting crystal.PNG\r\n\r\nYou should get your crystal located as shown below, and when rotating the phi axis it should remain centred on the cross hairs.   To do this, rotate the phi axis in 90\u00b0 increments and adjust. The height may also need altering, to do this use the grub screw then rotate the knurled collar to bring the crystal \u2018in and out\u2019 of the view you have.  Once centred, lock the phi axis using the lock screw at the bottom and close and lock the door of the diffractometer.  There is now no further need to open the door until you need to change the crystal for a different one. \r\n\r\nCentring 2.PNG\r\n\r\nUsing the video dialog box, you can switch between views inside the cabinet using the video tab, select capture device and then there are two options.  One shows the crystal position and the other gives an image of the inside for monitoring the experiment if needed.\r\n\r\nAlternative video views.PNG\r\n\r\nIn the video view, under the view tab the ruler can be selected and the crystal dimensions can be measured by dragging the ends of the double headed arrow to the edges of the crystal.  To rotate the crystal to a different view (to get the third dimension) use the R-AXIS window to change the phi angle and the goniometer will be rotated.    \r\n\r\nR-AXIS icon.PNG R-AXIS icon on the task bar if the window is not immediately obvious.  Enter a value for phi (90.00) and click ok.  The crystal will rotate and you can measure the third dimension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeasuring crystal dimensions.PNG\r\n\r\nIn the \u2018Setup and Mount Crystal\u2019 window (already open), you will need to enter the dimensions of your crystal, the appearance of the crystal (from drop down menus) and the molecular formula (using capital letters). \r\n\r\nSetup crystal.PNG\r\n\r\nWhen filled in as appropriate click \u2018Run\u2019.  The x-rays will then power up and the orange light on top of the XtaLAB mini will turn on.\r\n\r\n\r\nx-ray power up.PNG\r\n\r\nThe status in the instrument status display will change to \u2018collecting\u2019 and the shutter status will be seen to open and close.  \r\n\r\nCollecting.PNG\r\n\r\nOnce the first image is taken, it will appear on the screen. \r\n\r\n\r\nFirst image collected.PNG\r\n\r\nGood diffraction will give spots which cover over half to two thirds of the detector image originating from the top of the view shown.  Select Resolution Arcs and in the pop up window check the box at the top next to \u2018visible\u2019.  This will display red arcs which can show how good the diffraction is.  If spots are seen out to the 3rd band the diffraction is reasonable and structure solution will be possible.  If diffraction is seen out to the 4th band (or further) then the diffraction is really good.   Anything which does not have spots extending into the third band, or has poor intensity, could prove problematic in solution. \r\n\r\n\r\nResolution arcs visible.PNG\r\n\r\nThe estimated time to finish will be shown in the bottom left, and the image number (of 12) displayed on the right in the grey panel.\r\nWhen all images have finished collecting the flow will follow through to predicting the spots.  A pop up window will appear (Auto Cell Determination) showing the unit cell that has been found for the structure from the initial images.  In this box the exposure time can be altered if needed.  This should not need to be changed however increasing the exposure time can give greater intensity of diffraction if the initial images appeared with poor intensity.  At this point you must also decide if this is the crystal you wish to proceed with (it is not a twin and of sufficient quality).\r\n\r\n\r\nPredicted spots.PNG\r\n\r\nPress collect and the data collection will start giving the pop up window shown below.  This will show the time expected for the data collection and an estimated end time. \r\n\r\n\r\nCollecting data.PNG\r\n\r\nClick on the arrow under \u2018Scale and absorption\u2019 in the flow panel on the left to \u2018block off\u2019 the flow.\r\n\r\n\r\nblocking flow.PNG\r\n\r\nWhen the data collection is finished, click on \u2018integrate reflections\u2019 and the flow bar will then automatically be progressed to \u2018scale and absorption once the integration is run, giving a final pop up window displaying graphs.\r\nThe location chosen initially (for the project) will contain the output files for the data collection (shortcut to student data on the desktop). \r\n \r\nPROCESSING THE DATA FROM THE DIFFRACTOMETER\r\nBefore you can solve the structure from the data files given by the XtaLAB mini you must process the .hkl file to give an .ins file.  To do this, use Xplain (on the XtaLAB mini computer).  Input the reflection file (the .hkl file from the diffractometer) and the unit cell (the .cif file from the diffractometer).  Step through the tasks on the left hand side ensuring the information given on the right is as you would expect (given the unit cell you obtained from SCXRD and the knowledge from your literature searching).   Follow through to the end and write both files giving them a new (but the same) name (to indicate these are post-processing files). Upload the newly written .ins and .hkl files to your LabTrove notebook for use later.  \r\n",

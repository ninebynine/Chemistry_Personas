  "rdfs:comment": "Mettler Toledo FP90\r\n30:1049\r\n\r\n\r\nHSM overview.PNG\r\n\r\nThe basic steps for making a measurement are:\r\nEnsure computer, hot stage and microscope light are all turned on.\r\nTake the hot stage off the microscope (be careful of the fan, get a demonstrator to help if necessary)\r\nOpen the lid of the hot stage and slide the glass slide into the stage\r\n     \r\n\r\nHSM 1.PNG \r\n\r\nMark using a permanent pen where the viewing area is (draw a circle around the perimeter, allowing the full viewing area to be within the circle and the marker pen not obstructing it)\r\nRemove the slide, turn it over (so no pen contaminates sample) and place the sample (ensure it is DRY) onto the slide within the marked out area (so that it is within the small viewing area).  Note \u2013 you do not want too much sample.  One or two SMALL, nicely formed crystals is ample; less is more.\r\nCover with a cover slip and slide back into stage.  Close the lid\r\nReplace hot stage onto microscope. Take care of the wire going into the hot stage (get a demonstrator to help place the stage onto the microscope)\r\nLog the sample into the HSM log book (should be done every time you use this equipment) giving the date, time, sample name and operator\r\nOpen the Studio Capture program and the sample should appear on the display\r\nUse the focussing on the microscope, combined with moving the stage around a little to get a good image of the sample\r\nSet the avi file (file tab --> save avi) to save with an appropriate file name (this will appear on the video created), eg INITIALS_SAMPLENAME_METHOD in the Advanced Practical folder\r\nUse the controller under the microscope to set the temperature program (T Prog).  An ideal heat rate is 10\u00b0C/min with a start temperature slightly above ambient temperature (50\u00b0C). The heating does not need to go above 250\u00b0C\r\n \r\n\r\nHSM 2.PNG\r\n\r\nHSM 3.PNG \r\n\r\nScroll through the program and ensure YES is selected for \u2018stop after event\u2019 and IDLE for \u2018afterwards\u2019\r\nRUN will run the sample (press three times in total to start the heating process)\r\nEnsure the temperature displayed in the top right of the video starts to increase with heating and correlates to that displayed on the hot stage controller\r\nNOTE \u2013 the hot stage will get hot during the experiment \u2013 do not touch!\r\nThe play button will automatically start recording and saving the video.  This can be paused (Pause button) at any time to omit any circumstances where nothing is happening and the play button selected again when something of interest/temperature of interest is reached - this will save recording a lot of unnecessary video and having a very large file at the end\r\nAt any point the temperature can be held if you wish to look more closely at a specific temperature\r\nUsing the \u2018go to\u2019, any temperature can be selected and achieved almost immediately if you wish to get to a certain temperature\r\n \r\nWhen the program has finished it will stop recording and the hot stage will start to cool down.  Do not touch or remove the hot stage from the microscope until it has cooled to AT LEAST 40\u00b0C\r\n \r\nRemove and clean the slides and dispose of in glass bin\r\nTurn off microscope light if no-one is immediately using it after you.\r\nFiles will be saved in Crystallography Advanced Practical folder (video file and excel book, the latter is not important) for which there is a shortcut on desktop.\r\n\r\nFor each polymorph/experiment carried out you should note the following\r\nCrystal information: (size/shape/colour/general characteristics)\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nExperiment Profile:\r\n \r\n  \r\nOberservations/key points:\r\n(temperatures of interest/noteworthy, mp etc..)\r\n \r\nWhat does this show and tell you about the two polymorphs?\r\n \r\nAttach HSM video files for each polymorph\r\n",

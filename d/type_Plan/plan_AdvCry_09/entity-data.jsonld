  "rdfs:comment": "SCXRD: Producing the crystal structure\r\nSoftware: Olex2 \r\n \r\nENSURE YOU HAVE PROCESSED THE DATA USING XPLAIN ON THE DIFFRACTMETER COMPUTER BEFORE YOU START THIS.\r\n \r\nWhen solving the structure you should note down what YOU did - the parameters and commands used and the outcome of these showing how the structure was solved and refined to give an accurate representation of the chemical. \r\nYou should attach your final .cif file for each crystal structure (after structure solution), and write a short description of the structure including reasons why you believe, and can show, it is a true and accurate 3D representation of the compound.  (Include the unit cell and space group for each polymoprh and what these tell you about the two structures.)\r\nThere are four computers set up in 30:1069 with the appropriate software needed for structure solution and refinement.  These are primarily for solution and refinement as these are the only available computers with the necessary software on.  Other computers (university-based) are available for viewing structures, analysing data, database work and literature searching (the latter can also be done at home via the VPN).\r\nWhen solving the structure you should note down what YOU did - the parameters and commands used and the outcome of these showing how the structure was solved and refined to give an accurate representation of the chemical.   It is not crucial that you get the \u2018perfect\u2019 structure, but if the data is not as good as you may wish to get the best structure that you understand where your model falls down and be critical of this.\r\n \r\nYou should attach your final .cif file for each crystal structure, and write a short description of the structure including reasons why you believe, and can show, it is a true and accurate 3D representation of the compound.  Furthermore you should include the unit cell and space group for each polymorph and what these tell you about the two structures.\r\n \r\nSOLVING AND REFINING\r\nThe basic sequence once you have corrected data from the diffractometer is:\r\n\r\nStructure solution timeline.PNG\r\n\r\nThis is elaborated step by step below.\r\nOpen Olex2 software (freely available on the internet from http://www.olex2.org/download/).\r\nClick the \u2018Home\u2019 tab on the right hand side and under \u2018Start\u2019 open the required file navigating to the .ins file written from Xplain as detailed above.\r\n\r\nHome screen Olex.PNG\r\nWhen the .ins file is open (the display screen will be blank) click the work tab then the arrow next to solve to show the options for solving the structure. Click the \u2018solve\u2019 button and this will then show brown spheres indicating electron density peaks (Q Peaks) as seen below.\r\n\r\nQ peaks.PNG \r\n\r\nYou can see the peak height of each peak by either hovering the mouse pointer over the sphere or by using the \u2018info\u2019 tab and selecting electron density peaks. Peak height is related to the atomic mass relative to the other atoms in the structure ie larger Q-peaks relate to heavier atoms with higher atomic masses.\r\nUse the right hand mouse button to zoom in and out when you use the mouse, and hold the left hand button when moving the mouse to rotate the structure. \r\nUnder this menu you can also use the sliders to view only the strongest or weakest peaks, filtering out others (left side filters out most intense peaks, right side filters out weakest peaks).  Commands will be applied only to those selected, eg delete, select and name $Q C.\r\nTo view the intensities of the Q peaks, using the \u2018Toolbox work\u2019 tab halfway down the work panel, select \u2018Q Peak intensities\u2019 from the labels drop down list.  Also in the toolbox work area, the \u2018Q\u2019 symbol \r\n\r\nQ peaks icon.PNG can be used to change the display between the Q peaks, no Q peaks and bonded Q peaks (or press Ctrl+Q).   \r\n\r\nNote \u2013 not all Q peaks are necessarily real atoms therefore do not worry if some bonds do not seem to make chemical sense. If the Q peaks do not form a complete structure ie some are isolated or not sensibly connected, type \u201ccompaq \u2013a\u201d or use the\r\n\r\ncompaq-a icon.PNG button in the right hand panel.\r\n\r\nYou then need to assign atom types to the Q peaks.  Select atoms you believe to be of the same atom type (eg Carbon) which will turn green and then either type \u201cname C\u201d (for Carbon) or click the C/H/F/N\u2026 buttons on the right hand side.  Try to assign as many atom types as possible \u2013 it should be possible to locate all C and O atoms.\r\nOnce you have done the initial assignment, refine the structure to see how well the assignment fits the data and improve the model. Click the arrow next to the refine button to show the options, then click \u2018refine\u2019 when you are happy. Refining calculates structure factors based on the current structural model and then compares these to the experimentally measured values.\r\nIf a peak, after refinement, appears comparatively a lot larger than the others then this is not real and can be deleted.  Any peaks now greater than ~3 units on the difference map are missing C or O atoms.  Assign these then refine again.  Continue this until there are no more large Q peaks left.  Once all atoms are assigned to an atom type (and no large Q peaks left unsigned), the Q peaks can be hidden using Ctrl+Q or the Q peak icon \r\n\r\nQ peaks icon.PNG. It should be relatively easy to locate all the heavy atoms in this structure.  Remember, the R factor is not the only indication of the structure\u2019s quality.  Your structure should make chemical sense, ie the configuration and connectivity should be chemically correct (atom valence etc) with reasonable geometry (bond angles and lengths).\r\n\r\nRotate the structure and compare the size of the spheres for the atoms.  They should all be approximately the same size \u2013 if not, it is possible that you have incorrectly assigned an atom type. These are currently modelled isotropically with one parameter defining the displacement parameter.  The atom spheres should be approximately equal although exceptions do exist, for example in long alkyl chains such as butyl \u2013 the sphere size will generally increase along the chain.   Disorder can also affect the size of the spheres.\r\nIf a sphere appears too small in comparison to others in the structure it is a heavier atom than has been assigned (eg an oxygen assigned as a carbon) and if a sphere appears too large the opposite is true, the atom assigned is too heavy for the atom actually present. If spheres have become too small to see, draw a box (Shift+left mouse) around an atom to select it.  Cycle round altering atom types and refining until all spheres are a similar size.  At this point the R1 factor (top right) should be about 8-9%, the wR2 ~25%, difference map max ~0.7 e \u00c5-3 and min ~ -0.6 e \u00c5-3.\r\nWhen you have got to this stage, you then need to model the atoms anisotropically (as opposed to isotropically).  This will convert the spheres into \u2018rugby ball shapes\u2019 allowing for atomic displacement and give 6 parameters for atom positioning rather than one.  This should further reduce the R factor and increase the accuracy of the model. Click the rugby ball-shaped icon on the right hand side \r\n\r\nanisotropic icon.PNG and Olex will automatically model the atoms anisotropically.\r\n\r\nThe rugby balls (like the spheres before) should be of equal size and shape.  If there are any incorrect atom assignments, they will be displayed as tetrahedral-shaped atoms if the atom should be heavier than the assignment and larger ellipsoids if the atom should be lighter than the assignment given.  If reassignment is required it is best to reset them to spheres (select the sphere next to rugby ball icon) to give the isotropic atoms again, make the adjustments and refine before returning to the anisotropic rugby ball atoms. After this the R1 should be ~7-8%, wR2 ~20-21% and difference map max ~0.7 e \u00c5-3, min ~ -0.4 e \u00c5-3.\r\nNext, the hydrogen atoms should be added by clicking on \u2018Add H\u2019 next to the anisotropic and isotropic icons. Hydrogen atoms will automatically be added and included in subsequent refinements. The H button \r\n\r\nH icon.PNG can be used to toggle between including hydrogen atoms, showing hydrogen atoms with hydrogen bonding (red dashed line) and excluding hydrogen atoms.  Ensure that no extra hydrogen atoms have been added.  If so, delete all hydrogen atoms on the parent atom by selecting atoms and \u2018delete\u2019.  Refine the structure again.  Note, if some hydrogen atoms are selected and the delete all H atoms button \r\n\r\nkill H icon.PNG \r\n\r\nor command \u2018kill $H\u2019 is typed, only the selected hydrogen atoms will be deleted.   Repeat the hydrogen atom addition as before and only the missing hydrogen atoms will be added.  If there are still problems, or hydrogen atoms missing after using the Add H command these must be added manually.\r\nSome hydrogen atoms may not be correctly placed (especially OH groups) and therefore it is necessary to look at the Q peaks to see where the electron density is located.  To optimise the positions either multiple refinement cycles can be conducted and the H atoms may rotate onto the Q peaks. Alternatively, the hydrogen in question can be selected then Toolbox work \u00e0 Select group or atoms(s) and then\u2026 --> Fit.  Once in the \u2018Fit\u2019 mode, hold Shift down and this allows you to click and drag the hydrogen atoms to the desired position using the left mouse button.  When finished press Esc button to leave the \u2018Fit\u2019 mode.  After this, refine the structure again as this will adjust hydrogen atom positions to maintain the geometric constraints. To check the positions of the hydrogen atoms, the structure can be rotated and viewed from all angles to ensure the positions all look sensible. \r\nNext, use the \u2018Weights\u2019 option under refinement options (ensure the arrow next to \u2018refine\u2019 is in orange and pointing upwards to be able to see the refinement options).  Tick the \u2018Auto update weights\u2019 box and Refine several times until the weights do not change any more, and should turn green.  This is the solved and refined structure.\r\nNote: each time you make adjustments and refine, the quality and accuracy of the structure should be increasing and the R factor decreasing. By the end of the above cycles the R factor should be between 4-5%, wR2 around 10% and the largest Q peak in the difference map about 0.3 units.\r\n \r\nTIDYING THE STRUCTURE\r\nTo get the best structure, and most accurate representation of the compound there are certain values which should be monitored throughout the solving and refining process and can be found under the \u2018Info\u2019 tab and \u2018refinement indicators\u2019 header. \r\nThese are:\r\nR1\r\nwR2\r\nDifference map max and min\r\nGooF\r\nHooft y\r\nFlack x\r\nR1 and wR2 are an indication of the agreement between the observed and calculated structure factors (Fc and Fo).  These will reduce as the refinement progresses and the agreement improves.  High values (>40/70 respectively) indicate that the solution is incorrect.\r\nDifference map max/min gives information on the highest and lowest peaks and holes in the electron density map.\u2028GooF is the goodness of fit and should converge towards 1 towards the end of the refinement. \r\nThe last two, Hooft y and Flack x are applicable only for non-centrosymmetric space group structures (with no inversion centre).  They are displayed with an error and should be close to 0 if the solution is correct.  A value ~1 indicates that the structure should be inverted and those very different to 0 or 1 show a racemic twin.\r\nCheck the chemical composition is correct with no missing or extra atoms.  To amend the chemical formula to concur with that in the structure displayed click the \u2018OK\u2019 icon and refine again. \r\n\r\nchem formula icon.PNG\r\n\r\nWhen the structure and chemical formula are in agreement, the atom type buttons will turn green\r\n\r\natom buttons green.PNG\r\n\r\nNext, go to the \u2018Info\u2019 tab and to the \u2018Bad Reflections\u2019 header tab.  If any reflections have large\r\n|Fc2-Fo2| / esd values they may need to be omitted and will be obvious as they will be very different to the rest of the values.   If more than several are needing omitting they may require investigating.\r\n \r\nCHECKING THE STRUCTURE\r\nGeneral checks that should be made include:\u2028Visual check of the ellipsoids to ensure they are of similar size and proportions and look reasonable.\r\nCheck the number of hydrogen atoms present overall and on each parent atom.\r\nUnder the \u2018Info\u2019 tab, go to the \u2018Refinement Indicators\u2019 header and any errors in the parameters will be displayed in orange or red (depending upon the severity).\r\nCheck bond lengths and angles are sensible\r\nChecking bond lengths and angles:\r\nTo view the bond lengths \u2013\r\n1)     Hover mouse pointer over a bond and the length will be displayed or select the bond then right click to display the properties.\r\n2)     Select the involved atoms (two for bond length, three for bonded angle or four for torsion angle) then use the \u2018View\u2019 tab and \u2018Geometry\u2019 header tab to show the \u2018Distance and Angles\u2019 of the selection.\r\n3)     Right click on the molecule, Fragment \u00e0 Select bonds with select all bonds in the molecule.  Use the \u2018Tools\u2019 tab and Images header to select \u2018Label selected atoms\u2019.  To remove these labels you must be in Tools\u00e0Images.  Use Ctrl+A to select all labels then delete.  If atoms are selected, Crtl+I will invert the selection and the labels can then be deleted.\r\nComparisons and checks of bond lengths and angles can be made using the Cambridge Structural Database to ensure the values are sensible and within expected ranges.\r\n \r\nUncheck the \u2018merge CIF\u2019 box in the drop down report menu (arrow next to the title).\r\nOnce finished, you should check your .cif file to ensure there are no glaring errors with any part.  To do this, go to http://checkcif.iucr.org/ and upload your .cif file for checking.  Choose the \u2018validation of CIF only (no structure factors).\r\n\r\n\r\nchckcif.PNG\r\n\r\nThis will produce a guidance report with alerts of varying levels indicating areas that may need looking at or reviewing.  This can be downloaded as a pdf file and uploaded to LabTrove along with your .cif file.\r\n \r\nViewing the Crystal structure:\u2028Mercury (from CCDC, on all university computers) is sufficient to view, compare and analyse crystal structures (opens the .cif file).  There are other software packages available which have additional/alternative features should you wish to use them, such as Diamond, available under \u2018Your School Software\u2019 on university computers.\r\nSee the \u2018Using Mercury\u2019 guide for features such as overlaying structures and generating a calculated powder pattern from the crystal structure.\r\n",

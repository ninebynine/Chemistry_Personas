  "rdfs:comment": "Synthesis of MNR40-2 - extended reaction reaction time compared to MNR40-1\r\n\r\nTo a solution of KAB23-2 (0.10 g, 0.32 mmol) in dry acetonitrile (10 mL, Sigma sure/seal) and 3 \u00c5 molecular sieves (2 g, dried in microwave) under argon, was added was added acetyl chloride (0.02 mL, 0.32 mmol) and 2,6-lutidine (0.04 mL, 0.32 mmol, stored over 3 \u00c5 molecular sieves). Yb(OTf)3 (0.01 g, 0.02 mmol, 0.05 equiv) was added and the reaction was stirred at ambient temperature (~15 \u00b0C) for 38 hours.\r\n\r\nThe reaction was not worked up or taken forward as future reactions took priority.",

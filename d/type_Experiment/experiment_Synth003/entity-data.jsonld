  "rdfs:comment": "Synthesis of MNR40-3 - same reaction time as MNR40-1 but using reagents straight from the bottle and no molecular sieves\r\n\r\nProcedure\r\n\r\nTo a solution of KAB23-2 (0.10 g, 0.32 mmol) in acetonitrile (10 mL, HPLC grade) was added was added acetyl chloride (0.02 mL, 0.32 mmol) and 2,6-lutidine (0.04 mL, 0.32 mmol). Yb(OTf)3 (0.01 g, 0.02 mmol, 0.05 equiv) was added and the reaction was stirred at ambient temperature (~15 \u00b0C) for XX hours.\r\n\r\nMixture was clear then upon adding the AcCl the mixture turned yellow, then on adding the 2,6-lutidine the mixture went clear again. Reaction not under nitrogen or argon but flask sealed.\r\n\r\nThe reaction was never worked up or taken forward due to future reactions taking priority",
